# RLAC
RLAC is a AI based chatbot that at its core uses basic reinforced learning with the Epsilon-Greedy Policy
It by no means is a "State of the art" bot, it just uses base python libraries, and wasn't coded by a profesional. It is more of a fun gimmick me and some friends
created, but if you would like to use it feel free to. just respect the copyright laws. 

Note: I am not a professional programmer and there will be organization errors. If it annoys you enough just add it to pull requests and I will most likely edit it

# THIS IS A DEPRECATED PROJECT
I have kinda screwed up RLAC V1. I tried going way over my head, and I will tone it down in V2. You can access it here:
